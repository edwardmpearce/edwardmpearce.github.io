I am a PhD student and tutorial demonstrator in the School of Mathematics and Statistics at The University of Sheffield. I study interactions between algebraic geometry and combinatorics, in particular understanding topological properties of orbifold Hilbert schemes via core and quotient partitions and G-constellations. 

My broader academic interests include machine learning, its interplay with mathematics and statistics, and applications to data science. I have working experience in data analysis using Python, SQL, and mongoDB.
